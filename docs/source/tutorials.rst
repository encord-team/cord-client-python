The tutorials are separated into those that relate to *datasets* and those that relate to *projects*.

.. note::
    Throughout the tutorials, we use :class:`user_client <.EncordUserClient>`, :class:`dataset_client <.EncordClientDataset>` and :class:`project_client <.EncordClientProject>` extensively.
    We refer to the :ref:`authentication:Authentication` page for examples of how to instantiate those.
